find -like tool is a comand line interface, that will allow you to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
The synopsis of the command line interface adhere to the following format:
``find [--P | --L] [--exclude-dir=path] --path=path [expression]``

You can choose any of the below installation process.
Suggested : Docker, simplest and lightweight.

## Docker Prerequisite 
* [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)

## Docker installation for find_like

    $ git clone https://github.com/45minutepromise/find-like
    $ cd find-like
    $ docker build -t find_like .
    $ docker run -it find_like sh
    
After your docker shell container is up, following are the usages : 
    
    $ find_like --help
    /app $ find_like --help
    Usage:
    
        $ find_like [--P | --L] [--exclude-dir=path] --path=path [expression]
    
          find like helps you to search files, links or directories in your system based
          on the below rules. For example find_like --path=. --name=*.txt --type=f
    
    Options:
    
        --P                  Cause the file information and file type returned for each
                             symbolic link to be those of the link itself. This should be
                             the default behaviour.
        --L                  Cause the file information and file type returned for each
                             symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the link,
                             not the link itself. If the reference file does not exist,
                             the file information and type will be for the link itself.
        --exclude-dir=path   The directory tree specified by path will be excluded from
                             the list of directory trees searched by this tool.
        --path               Mandatory - Path to start search in your
                             directories.
        --type               True if the file is of the specified type. Possible file
                             types are as follows:                       d :directory     
                             f :regularfile                       l :symboliclink
        --name               True if the last component of the pathname being examined
                             matches  pattern .
        --rname              Like  -name , but the  pattern  is evaluated as a regular
                             expression.

## Command line Prerequisite 

1. Ruby 2.4 : You can use rvm to maintain your rubies and install ruby 2.4.
[RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

    $ `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`
    
2.  [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) Open a terminal
        
        $ gem install bundler
        
## Command line installation
Open a terminal and do following to get ready to use find_like
 
    $ git clone https://github.com/45minutepromise/find-like
    $ cd find-like
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake install
 

## Usage

Find like execute similar to how ```find``` command work on unix systems.

Lets try to understand each argument 

| Argument              | Description                                        |
| ---                  | ---                                              |
| `--path=path`          | This is a mandatory argument, provide path where you want to start search from.|
| `[--P or --L]`         | These are optional argument. --P is default, in case none is supplied. <br> --P - Cause the file information and file type returned for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself. This should be the default behaviour. <br> --L - Cause the file information and file type returned for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself. If the reference file does not exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.| 
| `--name=pattern`       | True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches pattern .|
| `--rname=pattern`      | True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular expression. To match a file named `'./foo/bar'`|
| `--type=f`             | True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular expression. To match a file named `'./foo/bar'`|


* `--path=path` 

```find_like --path='directory-path-to-start-search-from''```

```find_like --path=.```  
return all files/directory/links in the current directory recursively

```find_like --path=/Users/uditgupta```  
return all files/directory/links in `/Users/uditgupta` recursively

* `[--P | --L]`

-P - Cause the file information and file type returned for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself. This should be the default behaviour.<br>
-L - Cause the file information and file type returned for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself. If the reference file does not exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

```find_like --L --path=.```  
return all files/directory/links in the current directory recursively, including the paths to the symlinks if any, else will resolve to originals.

* `--name=pattern` 
```find_like --path=. --name=*.rb```  
return all files/directory/links that ends with .rb in the current directory recursively.

```find_like --path=/Users/uditgupta --name=test.rb```
return all files that ends with test.rb in the `/Users/uditgupta` directory recursively.

* `--rname=pattern` 
 you can use the regular expression `'.*/[ba]*'` or `'.*/foo/.*'` or `'/foo/ '`.
 
```find_like --L --path=/Users/uditgupta --name=*.rb --rname="*/foo/*"```  
return all files that ends with .rb and matches regular expression `*/foo/*` in the `/Users/uditgupta` directory recursively.

* `--type=f|d|l`

```find_like --path=. --type=d```
return only directories in current directory recursively.

```find_like --path=. --type=d```
return only files in current directory recursively.

```find_like --path=. --type=d```
return only links in current directory recursively.

* `--exclude-dir=name-of-the-directory`
 
`find_like --path=.  --exclude-dir=find_like`
return all files excluding the directory `find_like`.

`find_like --path=.  --exclude-dir=.git`
return all files excluding the directory `.git`.

## Continuous Integration  

Using Travis CI to keep a check on the health of `master` branch.
    [Travis find_like](https://travis-ci.org/45minutepromise/find-like)
   
 Each pushed commit runs the test, both spec and unit tests.
 + Check if the code passed the code analyzer  `Rubocop`
    [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

 + Check if the code coverage is upto the mark, using `coveralls` to handle that:
    [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/45minutepromise/find-like?branch=master)

 + Check if the documentation is up to date. Using Yard to handle library documentation
     [Yard](https://github.com/lsegal/yard)
   
    You can also read complete documentation of the find-like project here,
    [find-like](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/45minutepromise/find-like/master)
